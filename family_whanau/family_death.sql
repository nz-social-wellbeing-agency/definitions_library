Description:
The date and relationship to [snz_uid] of the death of an immediate family member.
Included relationships: children, parents, siblings (full or half), spouse 
(by marriage or civil-union), co-parent (partner with whom you had a child).

Intended purpose:
Identifying dates/periods where people are dealing with a death in their close family.
 
Inputs & Dependencies:
- [IDI_Clean].[data].[personal_detail]
- [IDI_Clean].[dia_clean].[marriages]
- [IDI_Clean].[dia_clean].[civil_unions]
Outputs:
- [IDI_UserCode].[DL-MAA20XX-YY].[d2g_family_death]

Notes:
1) There are many types of relationships that can not be identified using the IDI.
   This view is only those relationships we can observe with the available data.
2) Siblings are identified by people having at least one parent in common via DIA
   birth records. These may not go back far enough to identify siblings for older
   members of the population.
3) The marriage records contain a small number of records with the same partner snz_uid's
   (though other values of the record, such as date may differ). This includes couples who
   get married more than once on different dates. We have not filtered these out as they are
   a trivial proportion.
4) The relationship types are non-exclusive. So the same death can result in multiple
   records of different types (for example a single death can result in a person loosing
   both their spouse and co-partner if they were married and had children together).
5) The death of a child includes stillborn babies.
6) For simplicity we have NOT added a check that the person is alive when their family
   member dies. For example both spouses will have a record for each other's death,
   even if one dies several years before the other.
