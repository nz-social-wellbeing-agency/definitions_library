Description:
Debt, debt balances, and repayment for debtors owing money to MOJ Family Court Cost Contribution Order (FCCO).

Intended purpose:
1. Identifying debtors.
2. Calculating number of debts and total value of debts.
3. Calculating change in debts - due to borrowing or repayment.

Inputs & Dependencies:
- [IDI_Adhoc].[clean_read_DEBT].[moj_debt_fcco_monthly_balances]
- [IDI_Adhoc].[clean_read_DEBT].[moj_debt_identity_fml_and_adhoc]
- [IDI_Adhoc].[clean_read_DEBT].[moj_debt_data_link] 
- [IDI_Clean].[security].[concordance]
Outputs:
- [IDI_Sandpit].[DL-MAA20XX-YY].[d2gP2_fcco_transactions_ready]

Notes:
1. Date range for table [d2gP2_moj_debt_fcco_monthly_balances] is Jul2014 to Jan2021
	Family Court Contribution Orders were introduced in the 2014 family justice reforms.
	Hence there is no FCCO debt prior to 2014.
2. The first record closing_balance for each identity is equal to the sum of all the conponent:
   closing_balance[1] = new_debt_established[1] + repayments[1] + write_offs[1], the rest of the
   closing_balance (except first record) is the running balnce (which means that:
   closing_balance[i+1] = closing_balance[i] + new_debt_established[i+1] + repayments[i+1] + write_offs[i+1] 
   where i = 2, 3,...).
3. 12% of the fcco_file_nbr couldn't be link to the corresponding snz_uid in table [d2gP2_moj_fcco_debt_cases]
   14% of the fcco_file_nbr couldn't be link to the corresponding snz_uid in table [d2gP2_moj_fcco_debt_by_month]
4. A single person may have multiple fcco_fiel_nbrs for multiple debts or debt roles.
   After link the monthly debt to spine, only keep one record for each snz_uid (which means combine those rows with
   same snz_uid but different fcco_file_nbr)
   For debt case data, we would keep it as it is, as different fcco_file_nbr refer to deffierent debt or debt roles.
5. FML for the MoJ debt data is specific to the 20201020 refresh. 
6. Fast match loader:
   Run_key is a number that is specific to the linking of a specific dataset.
   Lhs_nbr is the let hand side identifier, also known as the snz_spine _uid.
   Rhs_nbr is the right_hand side identifier, also known as node. This is the uid that was created in the primary 
   series table related to the primary series key. 

Parameters & Present values:
  Current refresh = YYYYMM
  Prefix = d2gP2_
  Project schema = [DL-MAA20XX-YY]
