Description:
Main benefit receipt spells where a person is the primary recipient or a partner.
Beneficiary role (primary, partner, or single) and benefit type are provided.

Intended purpose:
Creating indicators of when/whether a person was receiving a benefit.
Identifying spells when a person is receiving a benefit.
Counting the number of days a person spends receiving benefit.
Can be subsetted by type and role.

Inputs & Dependencies:
- [IDI_Clean].[msd_clean].[msd_spell]
- [IDI_Clean].[msd_clean].[msd_partner]
- [IDI_Adhoc].[clean_read_MSD].[benefit_codes]
Outputs:
- [IDI_Sandpit].[DL-MAA20XX-YY].[d2gP2_abt_main_benefit_final]

 
Notes:
1) SAS code for the same purpose has been developed by Marc de Boer & the team at MSD.
   We provide this equivalent approach in SQL. As it is more compact, and has only the
   details necessary for the creation of this table.
2) As per the MSD data dictionary: Benefit tables in the IDI cover entitlements and
   IRD EMS records dispensing. Differences between these tables can be due to changes
   in entiltements, partial dispensing (e.g. due to automated deductions), and differences
   in timing (weekly/daily vs. monthly).
3) The script is long as several intermediate tables must first be built. All intermediate
   tables are deleted at the conclusion of the script.
4) Initial versions of this script used *_input views to create the final table instead of
   *_condensed. This resulted in overlapping output spells for the same benefit type.
   It was also inconsistent with the original methodology by Marc de Boer that does not reuse
   the input tables once they have been condensed.
5) The benefit type output (msd_spel_servf_code, msd_spel_add_servf_code, level 1-4) for
   people with [role] = 'partner' is not their benefit type but the benefit type of their
   partner who is the one receiving a main benefit. There will be a corresponding record
   for this person with [role] = 'primary'.
6) Note that in some refreshes Pensions (NZ Super) is one of the benefit types in the Benefit
   Dynamics Data. This category is not commonly included when MSD reports on benefits
   or beneficiaries. Hence researchers are advised to exclude this category in research
   focused on MSD main benefits.

Parameters & Present values:
  Current refresh = YYYYMM
  Prefix = tmp_
  Project schema = [DL-MAA20XX-YY]
 
Issues:
- A very small number of records are duplicates (<0.1%). As de-duplicating is very slow
  these have not been removed.
- Some identities have more than one main benefit at once. This results in overlapping spells.
- A very small number of partners (<0.5%) have main benefit spells at the same time as being
  the partner of another person's main benefit spell.
- Very slow. Runtime > 18 minutes.
 
History (reverse order):
2021-04-20 FL Filter out pension
2021-04-19 SA note added regarding Pensions in some refreshes
2021-01-19 SA corrected final query to use *_condensed instead of *_input,
			added indexes to intermediate tables,
			filter out 'Not On Main Benefit',
			filter out people being their own partner,
			'partner' label created using INNER JOIN replacing LEFT JOIN.
