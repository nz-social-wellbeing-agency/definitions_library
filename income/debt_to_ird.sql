Description:
Debt, debt balances, and repayment for debtors owing money to IRD.

Intended purpose:
1. Identifying debtors.
2. Calculating number of debts and total value of debts.
3. Calculating change in debts - due to borrowing or repayment.

Notes:
1. As tables are adhoc they need to be linked to IDI_Clean via agency specific uid's.
   Both IRD tables exhibit excellent correspondence to one-another and both link
   very well to the spine.
2. delta is the sum of assess, penalty, interest, account_maintenance, payment, remiss, the first record of each tax type should including
   the opening balance 
3. Some of the different debt types have different starting points.
   This is because of changes in IR's computer system between 2018 and 2020.
   It is not due to data missing from the table.
   Jordan's (IRD) response about this: There have been several releases as Inland Revenue are migrating completely over to our new tax system, 
   START. One of these key release dates was in April-2020 and specifically that was when the Income Tax type product was converted over.
   The collection case begin dates are correct if they were opened from before Jan-2019 but any specific historical transaction data is 
   essentially rolled up into a single converted transaction line item dated 20th April 2019. This is why it appears to have data missing 
   and only start from then.
      tax_type_group		start date  end date

4. Date range for dataset is 2019-01-31 to 2020-11-30. About 11% of debt cases arise before 2019. 
   If tax case started earlier than 2019 and unclosed until 2019-01-31, then there is a difference
   between [running_balance_tax_type] and [delta] at beginning of 2019.
5. Numbers represent changes in debt owing. So principle is positive, repayments are
   negative, interest is positive when charges and negative if reversed/waived.
   Around 2% assesses are negative. delta is the sum of the components
6. Each identity can have multiple cases, of different tax types, and case numbers are
   reused between tax types and individuals. 
7. Outliers:
   Very large positive and negative balances and delta values are observed in the data.
   Defining 'large values' as magnitudes in excess of $1 million, then a tiny fraction
   of people <0.1% have very large balances at any given time
8. 2% of the records has negative balance, only 0.4% of debt cases have negative debt balances
   of at least $100.
9. 46% of the records from [IDI_Adhoc].[clean_read_DEBT].[ir_debt_collection_cases] has NULL date_end
   Around 86% the records with NULL date_end has date_begin after 2018 (year 2018 excluded)
10. We consider a debt case is closed if the balance for a snz_uid within a snz_case_number and tax_type_group turns to 0. 
11. Opening date for a debt case in [ir_debt_collection_cases] is not consistent with the table [ir_debt_transactions],
   Recalculation of the open and close date for each debt case based on table [ir_debt_transactions] required. However, 
   the calculation is only an approximation, for two reasons:
   (1) Date range for dataset is 2019-01-31 to 2020-11-30. The open date for any case arise before 2019 will be extracted 
       from table [ir_debt_collection_cases]. However, [ir_debt_collection_cases] consider a case number as a debt case,
	   we consider each tax_type under a case number for a snz_uid as a debt case.
   (2) All the records in [ir_debt_transactions] are recored as the last date of the month rather than the exact date of 
       the transaction.
12. We observe student loan debt provided by IR in the table [ir_debt_transactions] to contain errors.
    - Double the amount of debt as reported outside the IDI
    - Double the amount of debt as observable in sla_clean.ird_overdue_debt
    - About half of all people with overdue student loan debt have multiple debt cases
	  (This is much higher than for all the other debt types).
    However, the number of people with debt is approximately consistent.

	Cause - due to a processing error IR has included both overdue AND non-overdue balance for some debtors.
	Initial solution - Join with SLA data and remove the debt cases most obviously wrong. Reduced error by two thirds.
	Fix - IR provided fresh overdue student loan information in table [ir_debt_transactions_student_202105].
		We replace student loan debt in the original table with the debt in this table.
		Original code moved to data exploration/unused definitions folder.
	Outstanding concerns - fix address majority of problem but still some differences from numbers reported outside the IDI.
13. There are around 3000 cases where the same identity has two (or more) records for the same month, tax type, and case number.
	This primariy affects Liable Parent debt. Our approach keeps all records, which is equivalent to assuming that the case
	numbers should be different.

Issues:
1. It seems that [running_balance_case] from table [ir_debt_transactions] is not correctly calculated, it doesn't sum up the
   running balance across the different tax type group with in a debt case.
