Description: 
Debt, debt balances, and repayment for debtors owing money to MOJ.

Intended purpose:
1. Identifying debtors.
2. Calculating number of debtors and total value of debts.
3. Calculating change in debts - due to borrowing or repayment.

Inputs & Dependencies:
- [IDI_Adhoc].[clean_read_DEBT].[moj_debt_full_summary_trimmed]
- [IDI_Adhoc].[clean_read_DEBT].[moj_debt_identity_fml_and_adhoc]
- [IDI_Adhoc].[clean_read_DEBT].[moj_debt_data_link] 
- [IDI_Clean].[security].[concordance]
Outputs:
- [IDI_Sandpit].[DL-MAA20XX-YY].[d2gP2_moj_transactions_ready]

Notes:
1. Date range for table [moj_debt_full_summary_trimmed] is Dec2010 - Dec2020.
   The balance in 2011 has no change for every month, we discard all data pre-2012.

2. Foe orginal data, numbers represent the amount of the money, they are all positive.
   Delta = penalty + impositions - payment - remittals + payment_reversal +remittal_reversal
   delta is calculated correctly.
   To keep consistency, in the final transaction views payment and remittals are switched as
   negative values.

3. If the first outstanding_balance for an identity may not equal to the delta, which means that 
   the outstanding_balance include the debt before 2012  
 
4. When we produce the table [d2gP2_tmp_moj_debt_cases], only debt incurred after 2012 will be 
   considered, because if a debt incurred before 2012, we don't know when exactly the debt 
   incurred. Thus, only 85% of the identities from [moj_debt_full_summary_trimmed] inculded in
   [d2gP2_tmp_moj_debt_cases].

5. A single person may have multiple PPNs for multiple debts or debt roles.
   We combined the debt for the same snz_uid with different moj_ppn (for monthly debt table),
   For debt case data, we keep it as it is, as different fcco_file_nbr refer to deffierent debt
   or debt roles.

6. The debt arise before 2012 most likely been paid off by end of 2018, it won't infulence too much on the
   analysis for 2019 and 2020 data; the total imposition debt is about 7 times more than penalty debt,
   thus we treat all the debt arise before 2012 as imposition on the date of the first record an individual has.
   An attempt of splitting debt repayment to repaid to debt arise before 2012, and to debt arise after 2012 in
   the file MoJ debt date investigation.sql. However, running the code takes extra time, and won't improve our 
   analysis significantly, that version has been abandoned.

7. The case of total repaid is more than total incurred has been observed.

8. This table contains debts from fines and infringements which have been imposed. These are not charges,
	which are more courts and tribunals related. (Email Stephanie Simpson, MoJ data SME, 2021-04-08)

9. FML for the MoJ debt data is specific to the 20201020 refresh. To use the data on a different refresh, 
   researchers have to first join it to the 20201020 refresh and then use snz_jus_uid to link to other refreshes.

10. Fast match loader:
    Run_key is a number that is specific to the linking of a specific dataset.
    Lhs_nbr is the let hand side identifier, also known as the snz_spine _uid.
    Rhs_nbr is the right_hand side identifier, also known as node. This is the uid that was created in the primary 
	series table related to the primary series key. 
    

Issue:
1. Data that has been linked with the Fast Match Loader (FML) requires some additional steps
   to connect to the spine.
   20% of the moj_ppn couldn't be link to the corresponding snz_uid in table [d2gP2_moj_debt_cases]
   30% of the moj_ppn couldn't be link to the corresponding snz_uid in table [d2gP2_moj_debt_by_month]

2. There are cases that individuals have outstanding balance from pre-2012, but the first transaction record 
   is not Janaury 2012. In this case, instead of record their outstanding balance before 2012 at January 2012, 
   we record it at the first date those individuals have a transaction record.
