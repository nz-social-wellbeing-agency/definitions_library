Notes:
1) Based on information received from Jo Fink, Ministry of Justice, Senior Analyst, Analysis and Modelling.
	Our thanks to Jo Fink for their help.
2) Much of the information that is used operationally by the Justice sector agencies for official statistics
	are not available in the IDI (e.g. Police family harm investigations, calls for service, Police Safety Orders,
	family violence flag, Protection Order applications, referral to non-violence programmes etc.).
3) This definition is likely to be an under count, both due to under-reporting and differences in data sources.
	For comparison, consider that the police family violence unit is called out aroun 120k times per year.
4) Sources used (administrative):
	- Police: victimisation from July 2014 onwards, proceedings from 2009 onwards
	- NIA links: offence information
	- Justice: charges from 1992 onwards
	- ACC: sensitive claims and injury claims based on keywords - awaiting SME review
	- Oranga Tamariki: reports of concern - currently not incorporated
