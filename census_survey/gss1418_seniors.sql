Description:
Health and wellbeing indicators from GSS 2014-2018 for vulnerable seniors.

Intended purpose:
Indicators from GSS 2014-2018 for MSD vulnerable seniors project

Inputs & Dependencies:
- [IDI_Clean].[gss_clean].[gss_person]
Outputs:
- [IDI_Sandpit].[DL-MAA20XX-YY].[defn_gss1418]

Notes:
 - null = don't know/refused answer 
 - '-1' means bad, 0 = neutral, 1 = good
 - GSS_person refers to questions asked to a reference person in a household and contains info on wellbeing/life satisfaction 
 - Around 26,000 rows for 3 GSS years
 - Start and end dates created to match panel population year definition (tax year april - march) 

Parameters & Present values:
  Current refresh = YYYYMM
  Prefix = defn_
  Project schema = [DL-MAA20XX-YY]
 

History (reverse order):
2022-07-15 VW Update mould definition (to 0/1 - has major mould problem = 1)
2022-06-17 VW Writing documentation, formatting, creating dates, dropping unused indicators (see v1 of definition for these)
2022-05-31 PM Definition creation
