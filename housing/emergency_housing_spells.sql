Description:
A spell for a person living in emergency housing.

Intended purpose:
1. Extract MSD third tier expenditure data related to emergency housing payments made to the recipients.
2. Join the one-off payments data with each other to form spells with start dates and end dates.

Inputs & Dependencies:
- [IDI_Clean].[msd_clean].[msd_third_tier_expenditure]

Outputs:
- [IDI_UserCode].[DL-MAA20XX-YY].[defn_emergency_housing]

Key rules:
1. 'IDI Adhoc Payments to Beneficiaries (Third Tier Expenditure)' table is located in [msd_clean].[msd_third_tier_expenditure] table in the [IDI_Clean] database. 
2. The dataset contains individuals from [msd_clean].[msd_third_tier_expenditure] table with the pay reason code of '855', which corresponds to 'Emergency Housing', based on the information obtained from [IDI_Metadata].[clean_read_CLASSIFICATIONS].[msd_income_support_pay_reason]. 
3. Any rows with duplicate snz_uid (STATSNZ unique identifier for individuals in the IDI), snz_msd_uid (MSD unique identifier for individuals) and msd_tte_app_date (the application date for the emergency housing) are removed. 
4. If an individual has multiple application dates close to each other, the data is merged together where the earliest application date is the 'start date' and the latest application date is the '[end_date]'. The threshold for merging the application dates is '23' days after analysing the time gaps between applications for individuals that have made multiple applications. In the analysis, Simon Anastasiadis and John Park found that a significant number of individuals that have made multiple applications have made subsequent applications 1 week, 2 weeks and 3 weeks after their first emergency housing application. The code for compacting the different rows into a single spell is derived from Vinay Benny's code from Social Investment Data Foundation (SIDF) library. 

Notes:
The dataset was tested on data from March 2019 to March 2021. 
Any inconsistencies and error with the MSD third tier expenditure data beyond those points have not been tested, 
nor any inconsistencies in the MSD third tier expenditure data through time beyond those points. In addition, 
the data for emergency housing goes from 11 September 2016 to 31 December 2021 for the March 2022 IDI refresh. 

The expected business key for the output dataset is one row per distinct snz_uid and start_date. 
In other words, one row per person (snz_uid) plus the date when they recived the adhoc payment (start_date).

Emergency housing is a form accommodation subsided by MSD for people that have no alternative housing options to 
stay for the night. If an individual meets the criteria for an emergency housing, then MSD will cover for the first 
7 nights at the emergency housing as long as 
- it is the recipient's first time at an emergency housing, OR 
- enough duration has passed since the last time recipient has been in an emergency housing and there's a 
  new reason for the recipient to need emergency housing

After 7 nights, the recipient needs to pay 25% of their income for the accommodation costs. If they have a partner, 
they will also need to pay 25% of their income. Income is any money coming in for the recipient, e.g., main benefit, Family Tax Credit.

From [Ministry of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD's) Quarterly Reports]( https://hud.govt.nz/asserts/News-and-Resources/Statistics-and-Research/Public-housing-reports/Quarterly-reports/Public-housing-Quarterly-Report-March-2021.pdf )
HUD further clarifies that emergency housing is a form of Special Needs Grants (SNGs) provided by MSD. 

1. [MSD MSD Benefit Dynamics Data and Income Support Expenditure Data Dictionary]( http://wprdtfs05/sites/DefaultProjectCollection/IDI/IDIwiki/UserWiki/Wiki%20Pages/02%20About%20the%20Data/IDI/Metadata/MSD/IDI%20MSD%20Benefit%20Dynamics%20Data%20and%20Income%20Support%20Expenditure%20data.aspx ) are available within the IDI. Most of these include one sentence descriptions of the IDI variables. Note that this link only works inside the IDI. Data on emergency housing is stored in the table 'IDI Adhoc Payments to Beneficiaries (Third Tier Expenditure)', which stores data on one-off payments made to beneficiaries, i.e., SNGs. 
2. As stated in the MSD benefits data dictionary, "the IDI Adhoc Payments to Beneficiaries table are extracted from SWIFTT, UCV and CURAM Replica tables."
3. Identifying the reason for the one-off payments can be located in the Metadata database in the IDI under [IDI_Metadata].[clean_read_CLASSIFICATIONS].[msd_income_support_pay_reason]. The reason code for a beneficiary receiving emergency housing is '855'. This was first identified by Craig Wright from Social Wellbeing Agency (SWA). Although the code '857' is emergency housing contributions, there no individuals with that specific code in the data. 
4. [HUD's Quarterly Reports]( https://hud.govt.nz/asserts/News-and-Resources/Statistics-and-Research/Public-housing-reports/Quarterly-reports/Public-housing-Quarterly-Report-March-2021.pdf ) provides an external reference for the number of people that have received Emergency Housing Special Needs Grants. The number of distinct individuals that have applied for emergency housing in the table 'IDI Adhoc Payments to Beneficiaries (Third Tier Expenditure)' gives numbers very close to the numbers reported by HUD.
