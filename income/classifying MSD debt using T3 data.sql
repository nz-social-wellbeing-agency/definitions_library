Description:
Debt to MSD categorised by type.

Intended purpose:
1. Intermediate table for detailed MSD debt to be extracted from.
2. Identifying debtors, type of debt, and changes in debt.

Inputs & Dependencies:
- [IDI_Adhoc].[clean_read_DEBT].[msd_debt_30sep]
- [IDI_Clean].[security].[concordance]
- [IDI_Clean].[msd_clean].[msd_third_tier_expenditure]

Outputs:
- [IDI_Sandpit].[DL-MAA2020-01].[d2gP2_classified_msd_debt]

Notes: 
1. Date range for table [msd_debt_30sep] is 2009-01-01 to 2020-09-01. Existing balances
	are created as new principle (amount incurred) on the opening date.
2. Numbers represent changes in debt owing. So principle is positive, repayments and
	write-offs are negative. A small number of repayments and write-offs are positive
	we assume these are reversals - and they increase debt in the same way as principle.
3. MSD debt data available at time of analysis does not classify MSD debt by type. We
	use the following method to classify MSD debt into recoverable assistance and
	overpayment:
	A) Fetch all T3 debt, filter to recoverable payments
	B) Split payments into 'within' month and 'at boundary of month'
		with 'boundary' defined as the last four days in the month.
	C) Group by identity and month and sum both dollar amounts.
	D) Join T3 payments to MSD debt
	E) Classify debt incurred into T3 (recoverable assistance) using the following order:
		- T3 payments 'within' a month
		- T3 payments on the border of the month
		- T3 payments on the border of the previous month that do not fit in previous month
	F) Any debt principle amounts not classified as due to T3 (recoverable) are classified
		as due to other, non-T3 causes (overpayment).
4. Consideration of 'within' vs. 'border' is necessary because recoverable assistance
	payments approved/made near the end of a month are sometimes recorded in the month
	and other times recorded in the next month.
5. Quality of this classification was assessed and found to be good. Consistent with other known
	sources of error in the IDI or better:
	- Of 8.9 million records, only 104,000 pass principle on the border to the next record.
		Of these we at most 7,700 could have error in timing (the wrong amount of border
		principle passed to the next month). But we estimate this is likely for only 1,600 records.
	- For 276,000 records (~3%) the amount of recoverable assistance from the T3 table is greater
		than the amount of debt recorded. Some of this will be due to differences in approvals
		and payment (e.g. $100 approved but only $99.97 needed).
	- Most debt classified as overpayment occurs within a benefit spell or at the end of a benefit spell
		as expected.
6. We do not attempt to distinguish between innocent overpayment debt and fraud. For two key reasons:
	A) No robust method for distinguishing the two in the available data.
	B) There are fewer than 600 fraud prosecutions each year but about 250,000 clients with an overpayment
		debt each year. So the percent of fraud cases is too small for approximate methods to work well
		(number from documents released by MSD under OIA).
	The best proxy we tested was to treat all principle amounts over $50,000 as fraud.
7. Performance can be slow: 14 minutes
